# Iris Data Analysis

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
The project was created in Python using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**, and run in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## What the Project Includes
- Loading and exploring the Iris dataset
- Summary statistics
- Checking for missing values
- Feature correlation
- Visualizing:
  - Boxplots of petal length by species
  - Scatter plots for petal length vs width

## Files
- `iris_analysis.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook with all the code and insights

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.13
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run It
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `iris_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run the cells step-by-step to explore the dataset

## Results
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for data visualization and feature comparison.  
This notebook shows clear distinctions between flower species using petal length and width, visualized through boxplots and scatter plots.
